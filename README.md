Section   A
You   need to answer any   FOUR questions   in this section.Each   question   carries   an equal weight.State explicitly whether   the following    statements are True or    False.Please   briefly   justify   your   answer   and   use   graphs   when   necessary.Each      question carries   10 marks.If   more   than 4   questions are addressed,only the   first 4   will   be   Considered.
1.[10   marks]If   bundle   a   is   on   the   same   indifference   curve   of   both   bundles   band   c,while   bundle   bisonly   on the   same   indifference   curve   of   bundle   a,the   completeness   property   is   satisfied for the   consumer.
2.[10   marks]If   a   and   b   are   two   bundles   of   good,the   following   writing   is   correct:a>b.
3.[10   marks]lf   a   consumer's   optimal   bundle   lies   inside   the   opportunity   set,we   can   state that   budget   coincides with   disposable   income.
4.[10       marks]Consider      the      following       bundle       (a,k),with       a,k∈N       (i.e.,α,k   are   integer   values).If   a   and   k   are   perfect   complements,the   two   utilities   U(a,1)and         )are   the   same.
5.[10   marks]Suppose   that   two   goods,X   and   Z,are   perfect   complements   (like tea   and sugar).Any   change   in their   relative   prices   modify the consumer's   optimal   bundle.(A   graphical   illustration   of the   main   argument would be   enough)
6.[10   marks]A   counter-clockwise   rotation   of   the   indifference   curve   around   bundle a defines   Elena's   indifference   map.The completeness   property   is   hence satisfied.
7.[10   marks]Suppose   Anna   calculates   the   expected   gain   from   hosting   an   event,which   depends   on whether   it   rains   on   that   day.However,since   the   event is in a remote location,there are no accessible official rain   statistics.In this    case,it is advisable that Anna adopts a frequentist   approach to estimate the likelihood   of   rain.
8.[10   marks]Assume   the   government   decides   to   subsidize   consumption   by   transferring   money on an equal basis to every   consumer.This   money   can   therefore    be   spent   for   consumption    purposes    only.Consumers'budget   lines would then rotate   inward.
Section   BMiriam's preferences between consuming   today,C₁(horizontal          axis代 写SESS0020-Topics in Microeconomics
代做程序编程语言),and   consuming   tomorrow,c₂(vertical   axis),can   be   expressed   by   the   utility   function   U(c₁,C₂)=K    C₁C₂.If    m₁is her income at time 1,m₂her income at time 2,and   if the   interest   rate   is   r   and   inflation   is   zero,then:
1.What   is   the   expression   for   Miriam's   inter-temporal   budget   line?[5   points]      2.What   is the optimal quantities of   consumption   at   time   1   and   2   for   Miriam?    [10   points]
3.Does   the   choice   of   k   influence   Miriam's   optimal   bundle?[5   points]   4.What   is   the   utility   associated   to   the   optimal   bundle?[5   points]
5.Under   which   condition   we   can   infer,from   the   optimal   bundle,that   Miriam   is   a   saver?[5   points]       [30   marks]
Section   C
You   need to answer ALL questions   in   this   section.   Question   C.1
A   and   B   are   two   consumers.Assume   that   the   income   of A   is   twice   the   income of   B.Considering   that   A   and   B   live   in   two   different   countries,we   know   that   the price   of good X for A   is twice   the   price   of   good   X   for   B,while   the   price   of   good Zis the same for   both   individuals.Moreover,we   know that the   price   of Zis   lower than   the   price   of   X   in   both   countries.Draw   the   two   budget   lines   on   the   same graph,placing   the   good Xon   the   horizontal   axis   and   the   good   Z   on   the   vertical axis.It can   be assumed that A considers X   and Z   as   perfect   substitutes   while   B considers   them   as   imperfect   substitutes,show   graphically   the   optimal   bundles for   both A   and   B.Let   us   call   △X the   difference   between the   optimal value   of X for   B   minus   the   optimal   value   of   X   for   A.Is   △X   positive,negative,or   equal   to zero?Explain   your   answer. [15   marks]
Question   C.2Consider   two   goods:X,represented   on   the   horizontal   axis,and   Z,represented   on   the   vertical   axis.Assume   that   the   bigger the   quantity   of good X   is,the   more   we are willing to substitute Z for X.Show this relationship graphically.Within the   context   of   consumers   preferences,what   are   the   main   characteristics   of   this   curve?Is   a   good   that   gives   you   addiction,like   a   drug,a   good   example   of X?
